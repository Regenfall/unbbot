## So, what does this bot do?
- Moderation (yep, like all other bots *¬Ø\(„ÉÑ)/¬Ø*)
- Money (each server has it's own economy)
- Casino / Gambling Games
- Earn money from chatting
- Tribes (Raids!)
- Other stuff that I've forgotten about

## How to Earn Money?
1. Contribute to chat in text channels (if it's been enabled in that channel) -> This doesn't mean spamm√É¬©!
2. Play Games -> See below for game commands.
3. Be a slut... Use the command `slut` to get some quick dirty cash.
4. If being a slut isn't your thing, you can work <u>instead</u> using the command `work`.
5. If you're feeling more risky, you can commit a crime <u>instead</u> using the command `crime`. This has a higher risk of failing, but also a higher payout.
6. Deposit money to the bank to earn interest and keep it safe. See the current interest rate using `bank`.

## What to do with Money Earned?
1. Use it as bets for games to earn even more money.
2. Purchase something from the store
3. Give it to another member? idk
4. Show off


# Commands
All commands much be initiated with the prefix. By default this is `!`. You can also `@mention` the bot.
For example `!help` or `@üçï unbelievable üçï#9038  help`.

The syntax of the command usage is:  Optional parameter: `[]` Required parameter: `<>`. **DO NOT INCLUDE THESE WHEN TYPING THE COMMAND**

**Some commands can only be used by  `Server Admin`, `Mod Role` or `Bot Commander`.** Note: Server Admin also has Mod Role & Bot Commander permissions.
